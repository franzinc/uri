Uniform Resource Identifiers for Common Lisp
	 
Description: Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for Common
Lisp. URIs, a superset of URLs, define a syntax for identifying an
abstract or physical resource. Read the RFC below for more general
information about URIs.

Author: Kevin Layer, Franz Inc.

This is the same URI implementation that first appeared in Allegro CL
6.0. Following RFC 2396 as closely as possible was an important goal
for the project, and some of the tests came directly from the RFC.
